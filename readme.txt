WPeMatico is autoblogging in the blink of an eye!  On complete autopilot WPeMatico gets new contents regularly for your site!

== Description ==
WPeMatico is a very easy to use autoblogging plugin. Organized into campaigns, it publishes your posts automatically from the RSS/Atom and XML feeds of your choice.

This plugin offers you a nice interface following the WordPress standards that allows you to manage in every campaign all the feeds you import. In order to make your site more user-friendly, you can fetch contents from multiple feeds and arrange them according to categories.

For XML and RSS fetching, it uses the Simplepie library included in Wordpress or forces to use the external library included in the plugin. As for image and files processing, it uses the core functions of Wordpress.

If you like WPeMatico, please [Rate 5 Stars](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/wpematico?rate=5#new-post) on Wordpress. Thanks! :)
